## Technologies

languages used are: 
- HTML : HTML5 -which is used to create the structure of the page
- CSS : CSS4 -used to style the page
- Javascript : used for code logic

### Features
* As a user you are able to:
    - Navigate to the site
    - Get a suggestion of drink of the day
    - Add the drink suggested to you favourites tab
    - Filter out only alcoholic drinks
    - Filter out only non-alcoholic drinks
    - Search for a specific drink

### Description
The site uses a public api to fetch details of cocktails . From the site a user can search for a specific cocktail. The result provides the user with instructions on how to make the said drinks and all the necessary ingredients needed

### Challenges
My main challenge was posting the drink added to favourites tab.Currently when one adds a drink to the favourite tab it can be seen but when one reloads the page the drink dissapears. This is because I cant make feth POST request to the API.
